    <p> At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research factility__ as long as the subjects<br> Fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated <br>researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the idea<br> you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order priority:</p><br>
     <p> Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of resveratro(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<br> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F),<br>when the audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup4></sup4></sup>.)<br><br>
</p>
<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musicial scores.</p>

expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd<br>
need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h2><strong> exotic dance move</strong></h2>Yes, you are right!As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dance.<br>To ansewr your question, my favourite dance are as follow, with definitions:</p>
 <dl>
    <dt>polynesian chicken dance</dt><dd> A litle known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village <br>would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>
 </dl>
 <dl> 
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt><dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warn,they used to practice<br> this dance,which bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements.One of the following<br>Students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern stylessuch as Twerking.
   </dd>
 </dl>
 <dl>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance </dt>
    <dd>An intresting example of hisstoric misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s<br>
        believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by <q>robotic,</q>stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of nortern Alaska and canada. later on<br>
        however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
        cold.
